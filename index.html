				<h2> Home... Fairmont, West Virginia</h2>
				<img src="Fairmont_West_Virginia.png" width= 363 height=184>
				<p> Born and raised in West Virginia, my family's decision was to move to New Bloomfield, Pennsylvania in fall of 2015. I lived in the same house between Fairmont and Wrothington until this took place. I was very involved in the community such as church, sports, outreaches, etc. I swam for Fairmont State University under their youth program, F.A.S.T. I participated in a ton of meets and recieved many ribbons. When I moved, I was not able to continue swimming and instead, found interest in volleyball. I've always found a love for sports and have done many in my past. I've participated in cheerleading, soccer, gymnastics, swimming, and now volleyball. I spent a lot of time at home as well as the church that both of my parents worked at. If I wasn't there, I was probably eating a pepperoni roll in some kind of resturant. </p>
				<p> There is no place like home. Country roads, take me home...<p>
				<h3>More About Me<h3>
				<img src="me.jpg">
				<p> I'm super outgoing, persistent, loud, and compassonate. When you first meet me, you'll think the complete opposite until i', comfortable. I love working with animals, technology, people, etc.. I enjoy watching movies, being warm, looking at the sky, and trying to do as many things as possible. I enjoy babysitting my nephew, Liam, and spending time with my brother and sister-in-law.</p>
